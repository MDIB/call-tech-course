1 -> (b)
2 -> (d), because Cmin has greater chances to always be zero 
3 -> 
P(h(x) == f(x)) = u
P(h(x) != f(x)) = 1 - u
P(f(x) == y) = ß
P(f(x) != y) = 1 - ß

P(h(x) == f(x)) AND P(f(x) == y)  ==> u * ß   Correct

P(h(x) == f(x)) AND P(f(x) != y)  ==> u * (1 - ß) Wrong

P(h(x) != f(x)) AND P(f(x) == y)  ==> (1 - u) * ß Wrong

P(h(x) != f(x)) AND P(f(x) != y)  ==> (1 - u) * (1 - ß) Correct  

So the probabilit of Wrong + Wrong = u * (1 - ß) + (1 - u) * ß
4 -> b
